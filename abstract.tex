Modern computer architectures are complex, with a wide range of
features that can be leveraged to optimize software performance.
However, efficiently optimizing software for these architectures
remains a challenging task. Traditional optimization techniques,
such as manual optimization by human experts or optimization by
compilers, may not fully exploit the unique features of novel
architectures, leading to suboptimal performance.

Program synthesis is a promising approach to address this challenge.
At its core, program synthesis searches for programs that meet a
specified set of requirements. Recent advances in SMT solvers and
increased computation power have made program synthesis a viable
choice for code generation. Program synthesis can generate code
specifically tailored to the target architecture, leveraging
domain-specific knowledge and advanced search techniques to create
highly optimized code.

The overall goal of this dissertation is to develop program
synthesizers that efficiently optimize software for emerging
architectures. The thesis statement of my dissertation is that program
synthesis can be used to generate highly optimized code for novel
architectures, outperforming traditional optimization techniques. To
achieve this goal, I develop program synthesizers that can
generate optimized code for a variety of hardware platforms. I
evaluate the effectiveness of these synthesizers by comparing the
generated code with manually optimized code and code generated by
traditional compilers. The results show that program synthesis can
produce code that is faster and more efficient than code generated by
traditional optimization techniques.

I present Minotaur, a superoptimizer that uses program synthesis
to optimize LLVM IR code. Minotaur extracts program slices from LLVM IR
code, and uses an SMT solver to find optimized versions of these slices.
Minotaur is designed to work within the LLVM optimization pipeline, and
can be used to discover new optimizations that are missed by traditional
compilers.

We present SCCL, a program synthesizer that optimizes collective
algorithms for parallel computation. SCCL uses domain-specific knowledge
about collective algorithms to generate highly optimized code for
specific architectures. SCCL is designed to be a drop-in replacement for
existing collective communication libraries, such as NVIDIA NCCL and AMD RCCL,
and can be used to improve the communication performance of parallel
applications.
