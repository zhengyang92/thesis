The rapid evolution of computer hardware introduces novel
architectures that demand efficient utilization for optimal performance.
These innovative architectures enhance the capabilities of processors,
enabling them to perform more complex tasks and improve overall efficiency.
%
For example, GPUs achieve high performance by utilizing specialized hardware
features specifically designed to optimize parallel processing and
computational tasks, and the Vector Processing Units (VPUs) within CPUs
are designed to handle vector operations efficiently,
making them particularly well-suited to applications
 such as video encoding, compression,
and image processing applications.
%
These cutting-edge new architectures are gathering significant interest
from software developers and researchers.

Programs running on top of these new architectures are either
optimized manually by human experts, or optimized by optimizing compilers.
However, both approaches struggle to keep pace
with innovations in architecture, as
the features in those new architectures may not be fully supported
or understood by existing compilers and experts;
%
additionally, optimizing compilers and experts usually rely on heuristics
to determine the best optimization strategies.
%
These heuristics might not be tailored to the specific features
of novel architectures, leading to suboptimal performance.
%
Consequently, efficiently optimizing programs for new architectures remains
a challenging endeavor.

Program synthesis is a promising approach to address the challenge.
%
At its core, program synthesis searches for programs
that meet a specified set of requirements.
%
Nowadays, the advances in SMT solvers and increased computation power
have made program synthesis a more viable choice for code generation.
%
There are several reasons why program synthesis can help address the challenge:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Adaptability}: Unlike optimizing compilers or human experts,
program synthesis can generate code specifically tailored to the
target architecture.
%minotaur
For example, in superoptimizers,
once the semantics of an instruction is fed into the refinement checker,
it can automatically generate code that takes advantage of the instruction.

\item \textbf{Domain-specific optimizations}: Program synthesis can take
into account the unique characteristics of a specific domain,
such as collective algorithms in parallel computation,
to create highly optimized code.
%sccl
This domain-aware optimization further enhances the
performance of applications on new architectures.

\item \textbf{Continuous improvement}: As an architecture evolves and
new features are introduced, program synthesis techniques can be updated
to incorporate these advancements, ensuring that the generated code remains
optimized over time.
\end{itemize}

This proposal focuses on developing program synthesizers
that aim to efficiently optimize software for emerging architectures.
