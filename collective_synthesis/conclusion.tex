\section{Conclusion}
This chapter introduces \tool: a systematic method to synthesize
algorithms in the Pareto-frontier spanning from the latency-optimal
algorithm to the bandwidth-optimal algorithm for a given collective on
an input topology. We characterize a class of algorithms that captures
a broad set of known algorithms and prove Pareto-optimality of both
known algorithms and synthesized new algorithms. We automatically
generate an implementation of these algorithms that is competitive
with manually hand-tuned communication kernels in use today.
