\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

We created \minotaur{} because we noticed that LLVM appeared to be missing
relatively obvious optimizations in code containing both its portable
vector instructions and also its platform-specific intrinsic
functions that provide direct access to hardware-level primitives.
%
\minotaur{} cuts loop-free DAGs of instructions---including branches and
memory operations---out of LLVM functions and then attempts to
synthesize better implementations for them.
%
When improved code is found, the optimization is performed and also
the synthesis result is cached.
%
On the libYUV test suite, \minotaur{} gives speedups up to 1.64x,
with an average speedup of 2.2\%.
