  Although an optimizing compiler often produces a fast program, we
  cannot expect it to produce an optimal program.
  %
  Moreover, the amount of headroom between the program we get and the
  optimally fast program is usually unknown.
  %
  A superoptimizing compiler---that performs a meaningful search of
  the program space---can help narrow this gap.
  %
  We created \tool{}, a superoptimizing LLVM pass that uses program
  synthesis to improve the quality of its code generation, with a
  specific focus on integer and floating-point SIMD code.
  %
  It discovers many profitable optimizations that are missing
  from LLVM, some of which have been implemented in LLVM as a result
  of our work.
  %
  On an Intel Cascade Lake processor, \tool{} achieves an average
  speedup of 7.3\% on the GNU Multiple Precision library (GMP)'s benchmark
  suite, with a maximum speedup of 13\%.
  %
  On SPEC CPU 2017, \tool{} produces an average speedup of 1.5\%, with
  a maximum speedup of 4.5\% for 638.imagick.
